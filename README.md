# MIDI Generator

A Node.js application that generates MIDI files with rhythmic variations based on configurable patterns. Built with NestJS and Scribbletune.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Working Prototype
This is an active and evolving project. The core functionality for generating complex, varied basslines is stable and ready to use. Future updates will expand its capabilities significantly. Feedback and contributions are highly welcome!

## Features

- Generate bassline patterns with configurable rhythmic variations
- Control musical parameters like key, scale, and tempo
- Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows
- Outputs standard MIDI files compatible with any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)
- Randomized variations while maintaining musical coherence

## üöÄ Roadmap
The vision for this generator is to become a comprehensive idea factory. Here's what's planned:

[x] Core CLI for generating bassline variations.

[ ] Add new generator types: Stabs (short, rhythmic chords) and evolving Pads.

[ ] Introduce more musical intelligence (e.g., velocity variations, call-and-response patterns).

[ ] Expand note selection logic (e.g., chord arpeggiation).

[ ] A potential Electron UI for a full desktop application experience.


## üîä Sound Examples
Listen to some patterns generated by this tool, rendered with various synths (like Serum and SubBoomBass2) in a DAW.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/midi-generator.git
cd midi-generator

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The application provides a command-line interface to generate MIDI files:

```bash
# Development mode
npm run start -- generate -c <path-to-config-file> -o <output-directory>

# Production mode
npm run start:prod -- generate -c <path-to-config-file> -o <output-directory>
```

Example:
```bash
npm run start -- generate -c ./control-input/dsharp-minor-bassline.json -o ./midi-output
```

### Configuration Files

The generator uses JSON configuration files to define the musical parameters. These files should be placed in the `control-input` directory.

Example configuration file:
```json
{
  "key": "d#",
  "scale": "minor",
  "bpm": 128,
  "variations": 5,
  "generators": [
    {
      "type": "bassline",
      "fileName": "bass_16th",
      "params": {
        "octave": 2,
        "pattern": "x_x-x_x_x_x-x___",
        "noteSelection": [1, 5],
        "subdiv": "16n"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "bassline",
      "fileName": "bass_8th",
      "params": {
        "octave": 2,
        "pattern": "x_x_x-x_",
        "noteSelection": [1, 3],
        "subdiv": "8n"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Configuration Parameters

- `key`: Musical key (e.g., "c", "d#", "f")
- `scale`: Musical scale (e.g., "minor", "major", "dorian")
- `bpm`: Tempo in beats per minute
- `variations`: Number of variations to generate
- `generators`: Array of generator configurations
  - `type`: Type of generator (currently supports "bassline")
  - `fileName`: Base name for the output files
  - `params`: Generator-specific parameters
    - `octave`: The octave number
    - `pattern`: Rhythm pattern where "x" represents a note and "_" represents a rest

### Output

The generated MIDI files will be saved to the specified output directory (defaults to `./midi-output`). Each variation will be named according to the pattern:

```
<fileName>_<variation-number>.mid
```

For example, with the configuration above, the following files would be generated:
- bass_8th_1.mid
- bass_8th_2.mid
- bass_8th_3.mid
- bass_8th_4.mid
- bass_8th_5.mid
- bass_16th_1.mid
- bass_16th_2.mid
- bass_16th_3.mid
- bass_16th_4.mid
- bass_16th_5.mid

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode with hot reload
npm run start:dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## How It Works

The MIDI Generator uses the [Scribbletune](https://scribbletune.com/) library to create MIDI clips based on the provided patterns. For each generator configuration:

1. The application reads the specified key and scale to determine the available notes
2. It uses the base pattern as a starting point
3. For each variation, it creates a modified version of the pattern by randomly altering some steps
4. It generates a MIDI clip using the pattern and writes it to a file

The randomization creates musically interesting variations while maintaining the core feel of the original pattern.
